Welcome to Apache ACE
=====================

Apache ACE is a software distribution framework that allows you to centrally
manage and distribute software components, configuration data and other
artifacts to target systems. It is built using OSGi and can be deployed in
different topologies. The target systems are usually also OSGi based, but
don't have to be.


Building Apache ACE
===================

Initial Setup
--------------

There are two ways of building and developing ACE: on the command line and
within Eclipse. Below are the requirements in case you want to be able to do
both:

1)  Install J2SE 6 SDK (or later), which can be downloaded from
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

2)  Make sure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the newly
    installed JDK location, and that your PATH includes
    %JAVA_HOME%\bin (windows) or $JAVA_HOME/bin (unix).

3)  Install Apache Ant 1.8 (or later), which can be downloaded from:
    http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi
    
4)  Install Eclipse, for example, Eclipse Juno with the following plugins:
    * Subclipse;
    * BndTools;
    * TestNG.

Building
--------

From the command line:

1)  Go into the build directory and invoke Ant:
    $ ant

2)  To generate a binary package, you can optionally invoke:
    $ ant -f bin-build.xml package

Within Eclipse:

From the main menu in Eclipse, choose: "File -> Import..." and then
select "General -> Existing projects into workspace..." and select
your workspace folder. A list of projects should show up now. Import
them all, wait until Eclipse has built the project and you're ready
to start.

The latest instructions can always be found on our website:
