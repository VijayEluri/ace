To update the initial Ace website:

1. Edit content here and commit your changes.

7. Run "svn up" in /www/incubator.apache.org/ace on people.apache.org
   to activate the live copy of the website. Note that there is a 
   delay (4 hours IIRC) for http://incubator.apache.org/ace
   to be updated once that happens.
