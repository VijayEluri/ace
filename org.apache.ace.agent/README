TODOs:

1) Download handler now store files in a tmp file and are not able to resume interrupted 
downloads from a new handle. This should be changed to storage in the data dir and using 
names that can be discovered and resumed.

2) Download result provide access to the download through a File. This should be an 
inputstream.


3) EventsHandler/EVentListener do not yet support an interest list like eventadmin does.
This should be added as it will help reduce event load if we start throwing more.
